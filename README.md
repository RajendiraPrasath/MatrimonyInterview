In this project, I have used data binding, ConstraintLayout, ViewPager2, Room Database, MVVM architecture, and Kotlin Flow for Asyncrouns data streaming.

In home page,
          I have stored 5 static profile data to the Room database. 
          Implemented a horizontal scroll view using RecyclerView. 
          Clicking the menu icon opens the gesture screen. 
          Clicking on an image or details text opens the product details page. 
          Clicking the 'Yes' or 'No' button removes the particular profile from the horizontal scroll.

In Gesture page,
          Displayed 5 static profiles in a card stack UI using ViewPager2. 
          When clicking the tick and cross icon buttons, remove the particular profile from the current card stack. 
          Clicking the back icon closes the current page and goes back to the previous page in the stack.

In Profile details page,
           All images are displayed in a carousel flow using ViewPager2, allowing left-to-right and right-to-left swiping. 
           Clicking the back icon navigates to the previous page."
